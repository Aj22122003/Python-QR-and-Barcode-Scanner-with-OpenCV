# Python Barcode and QR Code Scanner with OpenCV

This project implements a versatile barcode and QR code scanner using Python and OpenCV, designed to efficiently detect and decode codes from images or video streams. It offers robust functionality for both barcode and QR code recognition, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

## Key Features:

- **Barcode Scanning**: Detects and decodes various types of barcodes including UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, EAN-13, Code 39, Code 93, Code 128, and more.
- **QR Code Scanning**: Recognizes QR codes containing URLs, text, contact information, or other embedded data formats.
- **Image and Video Support**: Capable of scanning codes from static images as well as real-time video streams.
- **Accuracy and Speed**: Utilizes OpenCV's image processing capabilities for efficient code detection and decoding.

## Technologies Used:

- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the scanner functionality.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and real-time video handling.
- **ZBar** (optional): Integrates for enhanced barcode decoding support.
